# Daily Dev Web Practice
 Practicing with Daily Dev Website.
I was given an assignment in class to design Daily Dev website (https://daily.dev/). 
I created a sticky nav bar and other components of the website, inserting links accordingly.
My approach: I created the HTML structure, and linked to an external style sheet.
